# Stasinos-Projects

This repository contains my academic work in R and Python, focused on thesis research at the intersection of political economy and environmental policy, as well as complementary analytical projects. The core of the work investigates how economic conditions—measured by GDP per capita and instrumented via ETS (Emissions Trading System) prices—influence eurosceptic voting patterns across European regions. In addition, the repository includes a behavioral economics simulation project inspired by Akerlof's Market for Lemons.
